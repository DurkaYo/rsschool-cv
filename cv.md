## A little bit about yourself

I've been working as an HTML/UI developer for over 10 years now.

In my work, I pay attention to small things and do not have the habit of leaving unresolved issues.

I studied what is called - in the field, but I would like to get a full education in JS, especially since this is my second attempt to take the course

## Code example

Example taken from codewars.com *nickname: (DurkaYo)*

[**task**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/526dbd6c8c0eb53254000110)

>In this example you have to validate if a user input string is alphanumeric. The given string is not nil/null/NULL/None, so you don't have to check that.
>
>The string has the following conditions to be alphanumeric:
>* At least one character ("" is not valid)
>* Allowed characters are uppercase / lowercase latin letters and digits from 0 to 9
>* No whitespaces / underscore

**Solution**

```
const alphanumeric = string => {
  if (!string) {
    return false;
  } else {
    return string.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/g, '').length ? false : true;
  }
}
```
